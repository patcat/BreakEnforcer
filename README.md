Break Enforcer using BlueCats BLE Beacons
========

A prototype showing how to use BLE beacons from BlueCats in a PhoneGap application. It is a countdown timer for breaks which you can only reset after zero by getting up and going to a beacon to prove you have taken a break.

If you make something neat from this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com.
